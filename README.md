# Mario-Video-Game

This is my attempt to recreate the classic Mario video game using PyGame. This project focuses heavily on fundamental concepts like Object Oriented Programming to create objects players, enemies, obstacles, etc.

Integrated AWS technologies like Elastic Beanstalk to host this program online and CloudWatch to monitor different metrics like latency and frame rate
